            Americans have not sent astronauts on the moon since the 1960s. The
            next human space missions are scheduled to begin in 2027. I helped
            design and prototype a spacesuit interface to support human autonomy
            on these next series of space flights — procedural support,
            geological sampling, and adaptive navigation.

            Operations require direct support from ground stations on earth.
            They plan every step of the journey: timeline design to day-to-day
            tasks down to the minute. Brute-force simulations are run to uncover
            every edge case.

            Sustained human presence on the moon demands autonomous human
            operations — this requires learnable interfaces that can anticipate
            what a user needs before they ask.
